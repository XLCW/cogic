EVIDENCE CODES
==============

With the -evSet option is possible to select a specific subset of evidence codes to filter a reference database to calculate the IC. All possible group names are listed below. The evidence codes grouping is the same as described in the Gene Onotology website (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml). The only new subset is the "cafa" one that is composed by the same codes considered by the CAFA organizers.

FILE FORMAT & SOUCE
===================


IC program
----------

INPUT:

1 - Gene Ontology obo file 

		Downloaded from http://www.geneontology.org/GO.downloads.ontology.shtml


2 - Annotation database file (one of the following):

	- SwissProt flat file 

		Download the "TEXT" version from http://www.uniprot.org/downloads 

	- GoA
		
		Download the UniProtKB Gene association file from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/downloads.html

	- Short version file:

		You can create this file running the IC program with a SwissProt or GoA database as input. The first line must start with "##" followed by TAB delimited fields of "key:value" pairs. The keys must be identical as reported in the example: source file name = "Source", list of evidence codes considered = "EvidenceCodes", list of ontology used = "Ontology". All other lines contain the UniProtKB accession followed by a TAB and a list of space separated GO terms associaced with the relative ontology (i.e. P) and evidence code (i.e. IMP).   

		## Source:input/uniprot_sprot.dat	EvidenceCodes:TAS,IEP,IPI,IMP,EXP,IC,IGI,IDA	Ontology:P,C,F
		P37646	GO:0071111,F,IDA GO:0005515,F,IPI GO:0048870,P,IMP
		P37647	GO:0008673,F,IDA GO:0019698,P,IMP GO:0042840,P,IMP
		P37642	GO:0005215,F,IMP



OUTPUT:

1 - Information Content file

		The first line is the same as described for the "Short version file" (see INPUT). All other lines contains a go term and the corresponding ontology and information content value separated by a comma.

		## Source:input/uniprot_sprot.dat	EvidenceCodes:TAS,IEP,IMP,EXP,IC,IGI,IDA	Ontology:P,C,F
		GO:0046919,F,9.6770887085
		GO:0046430,P,11.5755715716
		GO:0021682,P,10.476959283


2 - Annotation database short version file 
		
		See "Short version file" in the INPUT section above for the format specifications.



COGIC program
-------------

INPUT:

1 - Gene Ontology obo file 

		Download from http://www.geneontology.org/GO.downloads.ontology.shtml


2 - Information Content file

		See "Information Content file" in the OUTPUT section of the IC program.


3 - Reference Annotation
		
		Each line must contains a target name and a go term separated with a space or a TAB. 

		T05187 GO:0008150
		T05187 GO:0009987
		T21397 GO:0070997
		T21397 GO:0010941	
		

4 - Predicted Annotation

		Each line must contains a target name, a go term and the corresponding score. All the three fields must be separated with a space or a TAB.

		T05187 GO:0008150 0.956472
		T05187 GO:0009987 0.564772
		T21397 GO:0070997 1.000000
		T21397 GO:0010941 0.564443
		

OUTPUT:

1 - Output score file
